I combine art and chemistry, music and programming, medicine, sports, travel and a healthy lifestyle. I think nothing is impossible. We just have to believe and work. The best job is the job you love.

##Skills:

- JavaScript, ReactJS
- HTML, SCSS, Adaptive layout (Flexbox, Grid)
- Git, GitHub

##Code sample:

```javascript
function spinWords() {
  let string = "She is driving a fast purple supercar";
  let words = string.split(" ");
  let result = words.map((word) => {
    if (word.length > 5) {
      return word.split("").reverse().join("");
    } else {
      return word;
    }
  });
  let finalString = result.join(" ");
  console.log(finalString);
}
spinWords();
```
